# Introduction
CancerEvolutionVisualization creates publication quality phylogenetic tree plots. For simple plots,
this package will handle most settings right out of the box. However, more complex
plots may require some trial and error to achieve the right arrangement of nodes
and branches.

This guide will show best practices for creating plots, as well as examples
of common use cases and tips for refining plot settings.
