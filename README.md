## Description

_CancerEvolutionVisualization_ (CEV) generates tree plots with precise branch lengths, gene annotations, and cellular prevalence. The package handles complex tree structures (angles, lengths, etc.) and can be further refined as needed by the user. These functions will give users great ease of use and customization options in broad use for biomedical applications, as well as general purpose plotting. Each of the functions also provides valid default settings to make plotting data more efficient and producing high quality plots with standard colour schemes simpler. All functions within this package are capable of producing plots that are of the quality to be presented in scientific publications and journals.
